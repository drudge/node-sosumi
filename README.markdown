# Susumi - Use Find My Phone services from your node.js apps

Find My Phone support for Nodejs. This allows you to programmatically retrieve your phone's current location and push messages (and an optional alarm) to the remote device, or even remotely lock the device.

This is essentially a port of Tyler Hall's [PHP Sosumi Class](http://github.com/tylerhall/sosumi).

## Installation

  Install the [npm package manager for nodejs](http://github.com/isaacs/npm)
  and run:
  
      $ npm install sosumi

## Examples

Event handling is optional, but sexy time.

    var util = require('util'),
        Sosumi = require('sosumi'),
        fmiService = new Sosumi('stevejobs', 'jizzmodo');
    
    // by default, devices are fetched when you create a new Sosumi object, a 'devices'
    // event is emitted on successful fetch. At this point, fmiService.devices is populated
    // as well.
    fmiService.on('devices', function (devices) {
        util.puts('Got our devices: ' + util.inspect(devices));
 
        if (devices != null) {
            // Blast a message out to all your registered devices
            for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
                fmiService.sendMessage('This is a test of the emergency broadcast system.', false, i, 'Important Message');
                
                // We can grab an event when a specific message has been sent
                fmiService.on('messageSent', function (content) {
                    util.puts('Sent the message: ' + util.inspect(content));
                });
           }
        }
    });
    
    // if something goes wrong, an error event is emitted with a description of the problem.
    fmiService.on('error', function(err) {
        throw err;
    });
